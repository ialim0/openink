        {/* Journey & Philosophy */}
        <h2 className={subheading}>Journey & Philosophy</h2>
        <p className={text}>
          My journey into software engineering began in an environment where reliable electricity and internet were never guaranteed. Learning to code meant late nights with borrowed equipment, unstable connections and a lot of trial and error. Over time, I became someone who is deeply passionate about creating technology that solves real problems. I enjoy writing code as a way to explore ideas, push boundaries and take on complex challenges that have a meaningful impact, especially for communities that are often left behind by traditional innovation.
